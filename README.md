# Stock Hawk

This is an implementation for Project #3 of Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801). 

The application fetches stock data from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/) via the [Quotes API](http://financequotes-api.com/) and displays overview and detailed information. New stocks can be added and removed by the user and a Home Screen widget is also available for use.


## Issues
